TODAY I LOST MY BEST FRIEND.  
HE IS A DOUBI.  
I COME GITHUB BECAUSE I WANT TO FIND HIM.  
BUT I KNOW MAYBE HE CAN'T BACK.  
I MISS HIM.  
```
Talk to me softly.
There's something in Ur eyes.
Don't hang Ur head in sorrow.
And please don't cry ! 
I know how U feel inside. 
I've been there before. 
Somethin's changin' inside U ! 
And don't U know ? 
Don't U cry tonight ! 
I still love U baby ! 
Don't U cry tonight ! 
Don't U cry tonight ! 
There's a heaven above U baby ! 
And don't U cry tonight ! 
Give me a whisper.
And give me a sigh.
Give me a kiss before U tell me goodbye ! 
Don't U take it so hard now ! 
And please don't take it so bad ! 
I'll still be thinkin' of U ! 
And the times we had-baby.
And don't U cry tonight ! 
Don't U cry tonight ! 
Don't U cry tonight ! 
There's a heaven above U baby ! 
And don't U cry tonight ! 
And please remember ! 
That I never lied ! 
And please remember ! 
How I felt inside now,honey ! 
U gotta make it Ur own way ! 
But U'll be alright now sugar ! 
U'll feel better tomorrow ! 
Come the morning light now baby ! 
And don't U cry tonight ! 
And don't U cry tonight ! 
And don't U cry tonight ! 
There's a heaven above U baby ! 
And don't U cry ! 
Don't U ever cry ! 
Don't U cry tonight ! 
Baby maybe someday.
Don't U cry ! 
Don't U ever cry ! 
Don't U cry ! 
Tonight ! 
```
